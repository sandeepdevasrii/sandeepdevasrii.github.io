    <h1 align="center"> Setting up Gitit personal wiki</h1>
      <p>
	<a href=https://github.com/jgm/gitit>Gittit</a> is a personal wiki (in fact, more than a personal wiki) which can be used
to keep a record of our day to day activity, lab reports, information about the research papers we read etc. Such a wiki is of
greatest importance if one wants to keep a track of one's day to day activities and other important stuffs in an electronic format,
i.e., in our personal computer or smart phone etc. My research for finding such a useful wiki software culminated in <b>gitit</b>
wiki software written using Haskell platform. In spite of a large number of wiki softwares available with hundreds of attractive
features varying from each other (A comparison of different wiki tools and their corresponding features is available at this
<a href=http://www.wikimatrix.org/>link</a>), my long eterm quest for getting the <b>right wiki software</b> has always addressed
the need of following features which I count to be <i>necessary</i> for my wiki software.
      <ol>
        <li>Wiki should be able to be opened for <i>reading/editing/adding wiki pages</i>, directly in all common browsers. </li>
        <li>Wiki should be able to opened remotely over LAN (not internet) for reading or editing in a remote browser.</li>
        <li>Wiki should support restricted access. Owner should be able to decide who can read/modify the contents.</li>
        <li>Wiki should support direct html editing if needed. Additional formats other than html are mostly welcomed..!!</li>
        <li>Most importantly, wiki should support LaTex based math rendering in some or the other way (may be mathjax ?)</li>
        <li> and some more which I do not remember for the time being..!! </li>
      </ol>
Gitit meets all these requirements. We can install it on our PC and use it for logging our day to day activity reports, or some
important notes to be remembered etc. etc. If gitit is running on our PC, we can access it from other PCs on the same LAN and the
read/modify access can be controlled through setting a security question. Gitit supports Mathjax for rendering math symbols and
equations. Configuring Mathjax is a bit tricky, if we need full featured LaTex support such as automatic equation numbering etc.,
but still can be done as we are going to see next.
<h3> Downloading gitit </h3>
Gitit can be downloaded from this <a href=https://github.com/jgm/gitit>link</a>.
<h3> Installation </h3>
We will not describe here the detailed steps for installing gitit as it is already available from the github page from
which we can download gitit. Please see the README.md available at this <a href=instructions://github.com/jgm/gitit>link</a>.
<h3> Configuring gitit </h3>
<ol>
<li><h4> Getting Mathjax working</h4></li>
Following are the step by step instructions for configuring Mathjax for LaTex based math rendering.<br /><br />
If you plan to use Mathjax available directly from the Mathjax server (if you don't want to keep your own local copy of Mathjax),
then follow the below given steps. Note that you cannot enable the equation auto numbering feature if you follow this method.
<ul>
<li> Go to the gitit installation directory. If gitit was installed from the linux repository, then this directory will most
probably be <code>/usr/share/gitit</code>. If gitit was installed using
<code>cabal</code>, then the installation directory will probably be <code>~/.cabal/share/gitit-XXXX</code>, where,
<code>XXXX</code> is the gitit version number.</li>
<li>Move to the directory named <code>data</code> and open the <code>default.conf</code> file for editing (You may need root
permissions if gitit was installed in <code>/usr/share</code>).</li>
<li> Find the line starting with <code>math:</code> and uncomment if it is already commented. Edit this line so that it looks like
<code>math: mathjax</code>.</li>
<li>Find and uncomment (if commented) the line starting with <code>mathjax-script:</code> and edit it as
<code>mathjax-script: http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML </code>.</li>
</ul>
Now you can use LaTex for rendering math symbols and equations in your wiki pages. Inline math should be enclosed in single
dollars as in the case of LaTex, whereas, display math should be enclosed in double dollars.<br /> 
Example of inline math: <code>$\alpha$</code><br  /> 
Example of display math:
<pre><code>
$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}
$$
</code></pre>
Note that, when Mathjax is used directly from the Mathjax server, we have to use a little piece of javascript code to configure the
Mathjax features such as equation autonumbering. That's how webpages configure Mathjax. I have previously written an <a href=
https://sandeepdevasrii.github.io/MathJaxRelated/mathjaxinfo.html>article</a> which describes how to use Mathjax in github
webpages. But, as gitit does not provide (at least I don't know) a feature for using this javascript code for configuring Mathjax,
we cannot configure some of the Mathjax features such as equation auto numbering etc., if you opt the above mentioned steps for
configuring Mathjax.
<br /><br />
If you wish to use a local copy of Mathjax so that you can configure Mathjax with the locally available configuration files,
please follow the below given steps for configuration. Note that the following steps will run a mini webserver for serving the
Mathjax.js file for gitit wiki. Mini webserver is written in Perl and is really "mini" in the sense that it can only be used for a
very very limited set of tasks (such as file serving) among a wide variety of tasks that can be done with a real http server.
<ul>
<li> Go to the gitit installation directory. If gitit was installed from the linux repository, then this directory will most
probably be <code>/usr/share/gitit</code>. If gitit was installed using
<code>cabal</code>, then the installation directory will probably be <code>~/.cabal/share/gitit-XXXX</code>, where,
<code>XXXX</code> is the gitit version number.</li>
<li>Move to the directory named <code>data</code> and open the <code>default.conf</code> file for editing (You may need root
permissions if gitit was installed in <code>/usr/share</code>).</li>
<li> Find the line starting with <code>math:</code> and uncomment if it is already commented. Edit this line so that it looks like
<code>math: mathjax</code>.</li>
<li>Find and uncomment (if commented) the line starting with <code>mathjax-script:</code> and edit it as
<code>mathjax-script: http://localhost:1234/Mathjax.js?config=default</code></li>.
<li>Download the <a href=http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/installation.html>latest version</a> of Mathjax and extract the downloaded zip archive</li>
<li>From the root directory of the unzipped Mathjax source files, move the directory named <code>config</code></li>
<li>Edit the default.js file to modify the line containing <code>autonumber: none</code> to <code>autonumber: AMS</code></li>
<li>Similarly, make sure that the line <code>['$','$'],</code> appearing immediately after the line <code>inlineMath: </code> is
uncommented.</li>
<li>Copy the Perl source code for mini webserver from <a href=http://www.wellho.net/resources/ex.php4?item=p402/miniserver.pl>this
page</a> and save it as <code>miniserver.pl</code> in the root directory of the unzipped Mathjax source archive.</li>
<li> Find out the line starting with <code>my $DOCUMENT_ROOT </code> in <code>miniserver.pl</code> and edit this line as
<code>my $DOCUMENT_ROOT =  "/path/to/Mathjax/root/directory";</code></li>
<li>Now create and save a bashscript file named <code>startwiki.sh</code> with the following contents
<pre><code>
#! /bin/bash
cd ~/
gitit &
~/path/to/Mathjax/root/directory/miniserver.pl 1234
</code></pre></li>
<li>Now you can start your gitit wiki by issuing the command <code>./startwiki.sh</code> in the terminal.</li>
<li>The above command (<code>./startwiki</code>) assumes that the command is issued from the directory where the bash script is
stored.</li>
<li>If you want the script to be started regardless of the directory you are in, copy the <code>startwiki.sh</code> file into the
<code>/bin</code> directory using the command <code>sudo cp startwiki.sh /bin/startwiki</code>.</li>
</ul>
The above procedure assumes that you run your wiki locally on your PC. If you want to access your wiki from a remote computer and
if you want your wiki pages with math contents to be rendered propoerly, follow the additional steps given below:
<ul>
<li>Make a copy of the file <code>default.conf</code> mentioned above in the same directory where it was originally saved</li>
<li>Rename the copy of <code>default.conf</code> as <code>defaultRemote.conf</code></li>
<li>Find and uncomment (if commented) the line starting with <code>mathjax-script: </code> and edit it as <code>mathjax-script:
http://ip-address-of-your-pc:1234/Mathjax.js?config=default</code></li>
<li> Now edit the above mentioned bash script as follows:
<pre><code>
#! /bin/bash
cd ~/
if [ -n "$1" ]; then
   if [ "$1" = r ]; then
      gitit -f /path/to/defaultRemote.conf &
   fi 
else
   gitit & 
fi
~/path/to/Mathjax/root/directory/miniserver.pl 1234
</code></pre></li>
<li>Now you can start your wiki by issuing the command <code>startwiki</code> (assuming that the bash script file
<code>startwiki.sh</code> is copied to the <code>/bin</code> directory) if you want to run your wiki locally, and, start the wiki
with command <code>startwiki r</code> if you want to run the wiki from a remote machine.</li>
<li>In line math can be obtained by enclosing within single dollars, whereas, display math should be enclosed in double dolloars.
Numbered equations can be written with <code>/begin{equation}.../end{equation}</code> as in the case of LaTex.</li>
<li>Equation arrays and <code>/begin{align}.../end{align}</code> environments can also be used in the same way as they are used in
LaTex.</li>
</ul>
The above procedure for configuring Mathjax assumes that your wiki root directory is same as your home directory. If you want your
wiki to be at some other directory, appropriately edit the line <code>cd ~/</code> in the bash script to point to your wiki root
directory.
