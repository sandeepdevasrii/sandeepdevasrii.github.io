    # vim configuration commands for ~/.vimrc
      <p>
        This page contains essential vim configuration commands which can be added in the ~/.vimrc file to configure vim.
        Once these commands are added to the ~/.vimrc file, they will take effect from the vim startup. If you dont want
        these options to be permanently set from the startup, these commands can be issued separately after loading vim.
      </p>
      ## Fix the right margin (text width)
        his option will limit the text to 'n' characters, where 'n' depends on your choice. While writing paragraphs with
        long sentences, a line will automatically wrap (a new line character will be inserted) to a new line if the number
        of characters in the line exeeds the count 'n'.<br/>
        <i>Command:</i><br/>
        <code>set textwidth=n</code><br/>
        <i>Example:</i><br/>
        <code>set textwidth=130</code>
