    <h1 align="center"> <code>fim</code> image viewer and <code>fimgs</code> pdf viewer </h1>
      <p>
        <code>fim</code> and <code>fimgs</code> are respectively the image viewer and pdf reader programs which can be used
        directly from a linux console like tty1. Most of the image viewers and pdf rendering tools are gui based, and hence
        require some graphical Desktop environment for running these tools. For example, if you try running the commonly used
        <b>Evnice</b> pdf rendering tool from tty11, you will get an error message "Cannot open display", which is obvious as tty1
        is just a linux console without X desktop environment, which cannot run X based programs. However, <code>fim</code> and
        <code>fimgs</code> are two tools which can run from a linux console and still can display images or render pdf files directly on
        the linux console..!! <code>fim</code> and <code>fimgs</code> are the improved versions of <code>fib</code> and <code>fbgs</code>
        utilities available on most (at least on ubuntu) of the linux repos which are functionality same as <code>fim</code> and
        <code>fimgs</code>. Unlike <code>fib</code> and <code>fbgs</code>, <code>fim</code> and <code>fimgs</code> have several improved
        features like vim like keybindings etc. If you are addicted to using only the linux console, these little utilities might be of
        great help. For example, if you use LateX to typeset a pdf document using vim editor, you may like to use the tty1 for doing the
        same, and you might want to compile the LateX source and see the output. If you use these tools, you don't have to switch back to
        the graphical Desktop environment to see the generated pdf file. Similary, if you are writing an image processing code using
        C++ and openCV, you may prefer to open some image, process it and store the results. Using these utilities, you can directly see
        the processed result from the linux console rather than switching to the graphical Desktop environment and using some image viewer
        to see the output. These little tools can be downloaded and installed from the following link (Installation instructions included
        with the source code is self explanatory and the required dependencies can be installed without much hassle).<br/>
